##Neighborhood Map Udacity Project
This app was built using create react app and it is the last project of the Udacity Front End Developer Course

This an app was created using Google Maps Api that shows the best places in Larnaca,Cyprus
Foursquare api was used to collect informartion about the locations,and to render the InfoWindow.
Please note some locations might not have all the details,there are shown only the details which are available on the page of FourSquare

###How to navigate

-> Click on any marker will open an infowindow that displays the name of the place and some information about the location
-> You can close the info window by clicking the X in the right corner
You can click on an item on the provided list and the appropriate marker will display its infowindow.
You can type in the input field and filter the beaches alphabetically (Try not to laugh with the weird Greek names).
If you are on a mobile or tablet screen, the list is automatically hidden, and you can open it by clicking on the SHOW button (and close it from the same button).
